        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>You control the chef sprite. Your aim is to dodge the enemy bullets and make it through as many dungeon rooms as possible. When all the enemies are dead in one room, you will automatically move on to the next room.</p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Use WASD, to move up, left, down, and right respectively.</p>
        <p>The game will auto-aim and shoot, so all you need to worry about it moving.</p>
      </section>
      <small>Note: Wave Function Collapse is not implemented into the game itself. It ran into too many errors and trying to solve the generation would have rendered the algorithm unreadable and wouldn't have ended up with a clean demonstration, so I scrapped the game implementation. The algorithm can still be played with in the demo page .</small>
